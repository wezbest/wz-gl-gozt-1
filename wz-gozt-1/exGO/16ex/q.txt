//--Summary:
//  Implement receiver functions to create stat modifications
//  for a video game character.
//
//--Requirements:
//* Implement a player having the following statistics:
//  - Health, Max Health
//  - Energy, Max Energy
//  - Name
//* Implement receiver functions to modify the `Health` and `Energy`
//  statistics of the player.
//  - Print out the statistic change within each function
//  - Execute each function at least once

--- 
My notes on this - So you will have to make a map with the variables, and then wrie functions 
to change each pair
- There are 3 distinct pairs here 
1. Health + MaxHealth
2. Energy + MaxEnergy
3. Name
